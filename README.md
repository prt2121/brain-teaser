[S-99: Ninety-Nine Scala Problems](http://aperiodic.net/phil/scala/s-99/)


> These are an adaptation of the Ninety-Nine Prolog Problems written by Werner Hett at the Berne University of Applied Sciences in Berne, Switzerland. I (Phil Gold) have altered them to be more amenable to programming in Scala. Feedback is appreciated, particularly on anything marked TODO.


[H-99: Ninety-Nine Haskell Problems](http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/H-99:_Ninety-Nine_Haskell_Problems)

> Haskell translations of Ninety-Nine Lisp Problems, which are themselves translations of Ninety-Nine Prolog Problems.
